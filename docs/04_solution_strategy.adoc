=== Technology decisions
 - React: React makes it easy for us to program user interfaces using JavaScript.
 - Solid: SOLID gives the user the ability to choose what data they want to provide, and makes it easier for us to access it.
 - BootStrap: Bootstrap makes it easy for us to develop HTML and CSS for the web application
 - MongoDB: MongoDB is a non-relational database which allows us to not have to model all relationships.
