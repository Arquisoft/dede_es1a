Motivation::


By using this structure, you can see an overview of how the application will work in runtime

Quality and/or Performance Features::

Despite the fact that issues such as connection speed or performance depend mainly on other aspects such as the internet connection, we have tried our best to create a clean code that achieves the best performance for the user.
With this, the intention is to achieve a good experience for the user in the use of the application.
